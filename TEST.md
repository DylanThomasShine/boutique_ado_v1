# Validation Testing

When testing for html it contained a lot of python code in it and as these results show I filtered the python code that showed as errors in the validator and I was left without any errors in the html code. I did this across the board while testing and when I had errors for the code I was testing I resolved them and the results are as follows. 

<br>

<h2>Line too long<h2> 

<br>

I did not know how to resolve these errors and in my research to find out how, they are classed as a style error and does not affect the code performance. I chose to ignore them and I dealt with any other error that arose, from trailing white lines to indents and so on.
